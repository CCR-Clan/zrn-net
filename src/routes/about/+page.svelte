			Zerion is a clan or orginization under CCR Clan which players of The Hood, The Hood FFA, The Hood 2, and other games by Funteam are found. This clan was created to account for the amount of people asking to join CCR Clan. Letting people into CCR isn't something we can do. Therefore, Zerion (ZRN) was created so people can be as close to CCR Clan as possible.
